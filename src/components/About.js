        <p>
          Welcome to my coding portfolio! My name is Malachi, and I am a
          Software Engineer. With a lifelong passion for technology and its
          potential to solve real-world problems, I am thrilled to pursue my
          dream of becoming a developer. What I find most intriguing about
          coding is its duality, allowing me to be both creative and logical at
          the same time. I thrive on taking complex problems and breaking them
          down into manageable pieces, only to then put them back together in a
          seamless manner. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I invite you to
          explore my work, and please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have
          any questions or would like to connect.
